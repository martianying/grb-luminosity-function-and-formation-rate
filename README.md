# grb-luminosity-function-and-formation-rate

This project was completed in Dec 2017 ~ June 2018 as a bachelor thesis. 

This respository stors python codes that I wrote for anaylyzing then-latest NASA public archived GRB data to construct the
luminosity function and formation rate using EP method and Lynden bell c method. 

Here I listed the resources related to the code:
1) this paper introduces the method to deal with truncated data to find if the responsor and indicator really relates.

2) I utilized the method above and got consistant result with the following paper though our datasets are different.
